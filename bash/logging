#This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.

#this is how you can redirect your stdout and stderr to a file
#while also printing them:

# >(command) : Process substitution--refer to command's input as a file
#tee: -a appends, -i ignores interrupts
#exec without a command applied redirections to the current shell
exec > >(tee -ai "$LOGFILE")
